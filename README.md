# <Challenge-4 Simple JavaScript Quiz>

## Description

This quiz was built as a way to better ones understanding of navigating the DOM and affecting
specific elements of a webpage.
I was able to make a page dynamically change based on what the user did, and score their score. 
All while a timer was running and subtracting time from wrong answers. 

## Installation

There are no additional steps to install. Merely navigate to the web page and click start.
